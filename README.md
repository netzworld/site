## Welcome to my website!

Here I **should** be progressing in my learning of web development as a side-hobby and skill set!

### So far I know a little bit:
###### 1/2/2022
+ Basic HTML tags and structure
+ Low-level CSS
+ Basic JavaScript <-- (Need to know more to do cooler stuff!)

### Some things that I would like to learn:
 - More diverse HTML tags
 - SASS or SCSS
	 + As well as how to make more complicated CSS elements
- Intermediate JavaScript
	+ Framework like React or Express
- Web hosting
	+ Such as hosting a web server on a Raspberry Pi
